# WebPractice

Past updates:

 make the to-do list so that it orders the assignments based on which assignments are coming up sooner, and which are due later on. Also, order it based on importance so that more important is higher up rather than lower. Also, make sure that the assignment has to have a real date, and it cant be too far ahead, or in the past. Also, add a clear all tasks button. Add an option to change themes of the to-do list, and add a bunch of different cool themes. Also,  add any other features you think would be cool.


also,  place the buttons somewhere else. Also, make it more refined, and color in all the buttons and input boxes to match the theme. Also, add more themes.


SO, these are all the things i need:   make 20 different themes..

CURRENTLY WORKING ON THE FOLLOWING:


Digital Clock:
The clock displays the time based on the selected timezone.
The clock is visible only when the user scrolls up.
When scrolling down, the clock should hide.
The clock displays in a large, digital, bubble effect style.
Clock Animation: The clock should have a subtle bubble effect animation when appearing.
Task Sorting:
Sorting by Importance: Tasks are sorted first by importance (high to low) and then by due date.
Timezone Selection for Clock:
Users can change the timezone to adjust the time displayed on the clock.
Customizable Background:
The clock's background color should match the theme when it appears.
JavaScript Features:
Live Clock:
Displays the current time in a digital format.
The clock should only appear when the user scrolls up on the page.
The clock should be updated every second and reflect the selected timezone.

make the clock display really big. It should not be moving. It should be animated that when the person scrolls on the webpage, when I scroll upwards, then I should see a really big display of the digital clock
